# SE60-FinalProject(Team05 - Parcel delivery system)  

## Introduction  

This project created for learning in Software Engineering subject at School of Computer Engineering, Suranaree University of Technology. In this project have developed by six students and they are Team05.    

At first, my professor will create and setup default project and gave that to all students for developing it.
This class we develop software by ReactJS(OnsenUI) and JAVA(Spring boot).    

I have developed two systems(sub-project), this is  
- Status notification system  
- Truck usage data system    

Then I have tested this software by Selenium IDE(Chrome) and use [Bats: Bash Automated Testing System](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)
you can look my test at ***bats_test > status_testcase_b5620203.bats*** and ***bats_test > truckusage_testcase_b5620203.bats***
